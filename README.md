# JuliaCoin

> Simple Blockchain implementation in Julia with its own API

## Background

This [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) repository is an exercise to reproduce the content from [Learn Blockchains by BuIlding One](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46). The value of this repository is purely educational. JuliaCoin in itself is not ready (and will most likely never be) for deployment.

Thanks to Daniel van Flymen ([@dvf](https://github.com/dvf)) for his very informative post.

## Implemented
- [x] Single node Blockchain logic
- [x] API built on [Genie.jl](https://github.com/GenieFramework/Genie.jl)
- [ ] Node consensus
- [ ] Test deployment on remote servers
